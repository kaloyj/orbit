<ReactExample exampleId="Toast-default" />

Toast shows a brief message that’s clear & understandable.
It’s shown temporarily, which means that it shouldn’t be used for error messages that block the user in continuing the flow.
Toast component is used for feedback from the app to the users for informing or warning them about different states.
Toast should only be used if there are no other ways of providing the feedback.

<UsageUse>

- Keep the text very short to make it easy for users to read it.
- Use Toast if it’s the only way of providing feedback.

</UsageUse>

<UsageDontUse>

- If the message should stay on the screen
- When you want to include an action
- When an action is necessary before continuing

</UsageDontUse>

## Component status

<ComponentStatus component="Toast" />

## Content structure

![Icon: optionally supports the message; message: works best as one line; close button: lets users close the toast](fileId:4QJZqvBvRrLu6t9mwObCkA;nodeId:798%3A2716)

## Behavior

### Use for non-critical messages

Toasts usually disappear on their own.
So any critical messages or errors that would block a user's flow don't get enough attention.

For errors and other critical messages,
place the message in the screen itself.
If the message is important but doesn't block the flow,
use an [alert](/components/information/alert/).
If the user should be blocked,
use a [modal](/components/overlay/modal/) or [dialog](/components/overlay/dialog/).

### Not actionable

Toasts are built for messages only, not actions.
They can include links to additional information,
but nothing that would be required.
Toasts can disappear, meaning the actions would too.

Make the actions available directly on the screen.
If there are actions associated with the message,
use an [alert](/components/information/alert/).
Otherwise, use [buttons and other action components](/guides/using-button-type-components/).

## Content

### Keep it short

Toasts only appear temporarily,
so there's no time for long messages.
Limit yourself to no more than 1 line.
Aim for shorter if possible.

If more information is necessary,
use a [text link](/components/action/textlink/)
to a more detailed description (don't truncate the toast itself).
